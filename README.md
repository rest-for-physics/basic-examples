* Contents:
 - `basic-geometries`: A repository containing basic geometry definitions written in GDML to be used with restG4.
 - `basic-readouts`: A repositort containing basic readout definitions to be used inside detectorlib for event reconstruction.
 - `basic-simulations` : TO BE added.
 - `basic-processing` : TO BE added.
