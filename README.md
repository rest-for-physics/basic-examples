This project just centralizes different basic repositories that contain examples of the use of different REST-for-Physics components.

* Contents:
 - `basic-geometries`: A repository containing basic geometry definitions written in GDML to be used with [restG4](https://github.com/rest-for-physics/restG4).
 - `basic-readouts`: A repository containing basic readout definitions to be used inside [detectorlib](https://github.com/rest-for-physics/detectorlib) for event reconstruction.
 - `basic-simulations` : TO BE added.
 - `basic-processing` : TO BE added.
